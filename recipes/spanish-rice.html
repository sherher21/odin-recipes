        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my second time making this dish so I'm not sure if it is correct or not but I'm recalling the recipe based on how I recently made it.  The recipe can definitely be improved but I haven't done enough research and had enough Spanish Rice to know what is good and what is better.  However, I still think this recipe will suffice for most palettes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Chicken Bouillon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Ingredients</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash rice thoroughly and drain.</li>
                <li>Peel garlic and onion.</li>
                <li>Cut onion and tomato into smaller chucks.</li>
                <li>Use a blender to blend onion tomato, onion, and garlic.</li>
                <li>Add water to dilute and continue to blend thoroughly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Toast rice in pan with oil.</li>
            <li>After rice has toasted and is starting to brown, add the blended mixture with the rice.</li>
            <li>Mix the rice and onion-tomato mixture thoroughly.</li>
            <li>If it looks like there's not enough water, add water to the rice.</li>
            <li>Once the rice has started to boil, turn down the heat and cover with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat and let the rice slowly cook.</li>
            <li>When the rice is almost done cooking, turn off the heat and let the rice finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Scrape the bottom of the pan to prevent the rice from burning too much and to make cleaning the pan easier.</li>
        </ol>
